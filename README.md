## README
The purpose of this package is to provide a quick and dirty opportunity "sizer" for univarite time series forecasting projects.  Specifically the intention of this package is baseline various classical time series forecasting methodolgies against the persistance method.  If the persistance method wins out, it is likely the series being dealt with is a random walk. This utility can be useful in feasability testing.  

#### Context
This utility was built during a half-day hackathon for AIM Consulting as part of an "innovation days" initiative.  It has not been cleaned up into an actual module, though I have used the code as a feasibility test in subsequent projects.

This repo is poorly organized at the time. The primary 'module' code can be found in the following path uffa/test_notebooks/uffa.py
